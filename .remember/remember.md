## Roadmap board live

Trading System Roadmap project: https://github.com/orgs/texastoasters/projects/1
- 51 issues seeded (#162–#212), labeled `roadmap` + `priority/Px` + `type/...`
- Status field: Backlog → Todo → In Progress → In Review → Blocked → Done
- Custom fields: Priority (P0–P5), Area (screener, watcher, portfolio_manager, executor, supervisor, dashboard, scripts, docs, infra)
- Workflow toggle for "PR merged → Done", "Item closed → Done" still pending UI step (GraphQL doesn't expose enable mutation)
- Workflow rule established: pick top Todo by priority, move to In Progress before starting work

## In flight

- **#162 — Foundation: Align backtest entry timing with live (next-bar open)** → branch `fix/backtest-execution-alignment` → status In Progress
  - Audit found v0.31.0 already fixed primary backtest scripts to `open[i+1]`
  - This PR adds `entry_timing` parameter + `scripts/backtest_exec_alignment_delta.py` + STRATEGY_REVIEW resolved-marker
  - Targeting v0.35.4
  - Real delta numbers require Alpaca creds (run on VPS post-merge)

## Strategy direction (agreed 2026-05-08)

1. **P0 Foundation first** — measurement system (backtest/live alignment, gap-up exit, MC bootstrap, purged k-fold CV, deflated Sharpe). Don't add strategies on top of unverified backtests.
2. **P1 TSMOM next** — time-series momentum (Moskowitz 2012) as second primary strategy. Long-only, monthly rebalance, anti-correlated with mean-reversion. Fixes DOWNTREND dead zone.
3. **P4 deferred decision** post-TSMOM — PEAD vs Options Wheel. Wheel unlocks vol risk premium return source if multi-strategy plumbing proves clean.
4. **Skip:** stockmarketguides.com (no API, unauditable). ORB intraday until daily system rock-solid. Pure factor (low capacity at $5K).
